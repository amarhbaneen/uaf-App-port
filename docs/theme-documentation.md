# üß© UFng Developer Design & Styling Guidelines

**Project Stack:** Angular + PrimeNG + PrimeIcons + PrimeFlex + Custom Designer Theme

---

## Overview

The UAF Components library includes a custom theme for PrimeNG components. This theme provides consistent styling across all PrimeNG UI components while adhering to the UAF design system.

## üéØ General Principles

We aim for:

- Full adoption of **PrimeNG‚Äôs ecosystem**: components, icons, layout, and theme.
- Centralized, scalable styling using **PrimeNG‚Äôs theming system** and **design tokens**.
- SCSS usage **only when absolutely necessary**, and always via defined tokens.

---

## PrimeNG Component Usage

There are two ways to use PrimeNG UI elements:

### 1. Component-Based Approach (Preferred)

```html
<p-button type="button" label="Click me"></p-button>
```

**Why we prefer this:**

- Aligns with PrimeNG‚Äôs recommended usage.
- Ensures consistency across the app.
- Provides richer features, theme support, and better integration.

### 2. Directive-Based Approach (Used Only If Needed)

```html
<button pButton type="button" label="Click me"></button>
```

**When to consider it:**

- Lightweight, minimal buttons are needed.
- Native HTML behavior must be preserved.
- Only basic styling/events are required.

> **‚úÖ Recommendation:** Use _proper PrimeNG components_ wherever possible.  
> Use the directive syntax only for legacy code or minimal use cases.

## üé® Styling Strategy & Theme Structure

We follow a **three-tiered structure** for styling:

1. **Global SCSS styles** (not PrimeNG-specific but better to use PrimeNG's styles) in:  
   `src/styles.scss`

2. **PrimeNG-level theme files** in:  
   `src/app/theme/eg-factory/`

3. **Component-level style file** in:  
   `src/app/components/<component_name>/component_name.scss`


And should be organized as follows:

- **Global Style File**: `styles.scss` contains only the global styling which is not connected to PrimeNG components.

- **Custom Theme Configurations Files**: into src/app/theme/ directory. The `index.ts` exports all this configuration when the `base.ts` includes the whole design schema and into the components/ directory a config TS file exists for each PrimeNG's component.

- **Local Style Files**: `ComponentName.scss` contain only the local design.

## Features

The UAF theme includes:

1. **PrimeNG Base & Components Styling**: PrimeNG style configuration including basic styling and implementing this to define and custom the style of PrimeNG's components like buttons, cards, and input fields.

2. **Dark Mode Support**: Comprehensive dark mode styling that can be activated by adding the `.dark` class to the required element.

3. **Custom Typography**: Uses "Varela Round" as the default font family.

---

## üéØ Use Theme Tokens ‚Äî Not Hardcoded Values

To ensure consistency and centralized maintenance, always use design tokens defined in the theme's `base.ts`.

### Token Usage:

- **Inside PrimeNG theme files:**  
  Use the curly-brace syntax:

  ```ts
  fontFamily: "{primitive.fontFamily.body}"
  ```

- **Inside SCSS files:**  
  Use CSS custom properties that PrimeNG generates:

  ```scss
  body {
    font-family: var(--eg-font-family-body);
  }
  ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è PrimeNG automatically transforms tokens like `primitive.fontFamily.body` into CSS variables with a prefix (e.g., `--p-font-family-body` for PrimeNG default prefix `--p`).  
> In our app, the prefix is customized to `--eg`, so the token becomes: `--eg-font-family-body`.

---

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is supported through the `.dark` selector:

```ts
import {providePrimeNG} from "primeng/config";

providePrimeNG({
  theme: {
    preset: MyCustomTheme,
    options:{
      darkModeSelector: '.dark',
      prefix: 'eg'
    }
  }
})
```

When this class is applied to the current element, all components will switch to their dark mode styling

---

## üìå Additional Notes

- Use **PrimeFlex** for layout (e.g., grids, spacing utilities).
 
- Use **PrimeIcons** for iconography.
 
- Avoid defining styles manually unless the design requires it ‚Äî always prefer design tokens.

- Local SCSS should only be used for **component-specific overrides**, and even then with design token variables when possible.

---

## Using in A Consumer Application

To use the UAF theme in your application:

1. **Install the Library**:
   ```
   npm install @amarhbaneen/uaf-components
   ```

2. **Import the Theme**:
   Add the following import to your application's global styles file (e.g., `styles.scss`):
   ```scss
   @import "@amarhbaneen/uaf-components/src/lib/themes/index";
   ```

This is enough to enable our custom theme and the dark / light mode:

- The app listens for the `.dark` class (on a root element like `<html>`) to trigger dark mode.
- All CSS variables will change based on whether `.dark` is preset or not.

---

## üé® Styling Strategy for a Consumer App

You can customize the theme by overriding the styles in your application's styles file after importing the UFng theme. Follow the UFng style strategy!

üîß Steps for the Consumer App to Style Its Own Components Including for Dark Mode

1. **Use CSS Custom Properties (from eg theme)** - PrimeNG transforms our `base.ts` design tokens into CSS custom properties, like:

    ```css
    --eg-surface-background
    --eg-text-color
    --eg-font-family-body
    ```

    Thus, In the host component's SCSS or CSS, use those variables:
    
    ```scss
    :host {
      background-color: var(--eg-surface-background);
      color: var(--eg-text-color);
      font-family: var(--eg-font-family-body);
    }
    ```
    
    ‚û°Ô∏è These values will automatically update when the `.dark` class is present.


2. **Make Sure the `.dark` Class is in the Scope** - You're using:
    
    ```ts
    darkModeSelector: '.dark'
    ```
    
    So your host app must:
    
    - Add `.dark` to <html> (which is already done for the ready base and components).
    
    - Write your styles so that they respond to that scope, if needed.
    
    Usually, **you do NOT need to manually write `.dark` conditions** if you're using the CSS variables correctly.
    
    But if you must override something directly, do this:
    
    ```scss
    :host-context(.dark) {
    background-color: var(--eg-surface-dark-background);
    }
    ```
    
3. **Optional: Use the Same Design Tokens Even If Overriding is Required** - even when something has to be overrided manually, not handled by our theme, keep things fully aligned by preferring our token usage. Your host app can reference token names defined in `base.ts` or component theme files.
    
    For example, you can use an Angular-specific CSS selector that lets a component's style react to a parent class and use `base.ts` for that:
    
   ```scss
    // Component styles that adapt to theme
    :host {
      background-color: var(--surface-a);
      color: var(--text-color);
   
      // Dark mode specific overrides
      :host-context(.dark) & {
      // Additional dark mode styles if needed
      }
    }
    ```
    
    What this does:
    
    - Applied the `background-color` using the `--eg-surface-background` variable (only) when `.dark` is somewhere in the ancestor DOM tree - typically `<html class="dark"`.
    
4. **Do NOT hardcode colors** (unless absolutely needed)
    
    ‚ùå Avoid:
    
    ```scss
    background-color: #fff; // or #121212
    ```
    
    ‚úÖ Use:
    
    ```scss
    background-color: var(--eg-surface-background);
    ```
    
    This ensures your component auto-updates when dark mode is toggled.

## Theme Toggle

This part provides comprehensive documentation for the theme toggling option in the Universal Framework NG. The theme system allows components to easily implement light/dark mode functionality with minimal code duplication.

### Architecture

The theme system consists of three main parts:

1. *ThemeService* - A singleton service that manages the theme state
2. *ThemeAwareBase* - An abstract base class that components can extend to get theme functionality
3. *Component implementations* - Components that extend ThemeAwareBase

#### ThemeService

The `ThemeService` is responsible for:

* Storing the current theme state (light or dark)
* Providing methods to toggle or set the theme
* Broadcasting theme changes to subscribers
* Persisting theme preferences in localStorage
* Applying theme classes to the DOM

#### ThemeAwareBase

The `ThemeAwareBase` class is an abstract class that:

* Subscribes to theme changes from ThemeService
* Provides properties for components to use (isDarkMode, themeIcon)
* Handles cleanup of subscriptions
* Provides a toggleTheme method

#### Component Implementations

Components that need theme functionality should extend `ThemeAwareBase` and:

* Pass the ThemeService to the base class constructor
* Override the usesThemeIcon method if they need the theme icon
* Use the isDarkMode and themeIcon properties in their templates

### How to Use

#### Adding Theme Support to a New Component

To add theme support to a new component:

1. Import ThemeService and ThemeAwareBase
2. Extend ThemeAwareBase
3. Inject ThemeService and pass it to super()
4. Override usesThemeIcon() if needed
5. Use isDarkMode and themeIcon in your template

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ThemeService } from '../../services/theme.service';
import { ThemeAwareBase } from '../../shared/theme-aware.base';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.scss']
})
export class MyComponent extends ThemeAwareBase {
  constructor(themeService: ThemeService) {
      super(themeService);
  }
  
  // Override this method if your component needs the theme icon
  protected override usesThemeIcon(): boolean {
      return true; // or false if you don't need the icon
  }
}
```

#### Using Theme Properties in Templates

In your component's template, you can use the inherited properties:

```html
  <!-- Using isDarkMode for conditional rendering -->
  <div [ngClass]="{'dark-content': isDarkMode, 'light-content': !isDarkMode}">
    Content that changes with theme
  </div>
  
  <!-- Using themeIcon for theme toggle button (if usesThemeIcon returns true) -->
  <button pButton [icon]="themeIcon" (click)="toggleTheme()"></button>
```

### Best Practices

#### Do's

* DO extend ThemeAwareBase for components that need theme awareness
* DO use the isDarkMode property for conditional rendering
* DO override usesThemeIcon() to return true if your component displays a theme toggle icon
* DO use the toggleTheme() method for theme toggle buttons

#### Don'ts

* DON'T directly manipulate the DOM to apply theme classes
* DON'T store theme state in component properties
* DON'T implement your own theme toggle logic
* DON'T forget to pass ThemeService to super() in your constructor

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

##### Theme Not Updating

If your component's theme is not updating when the theme is toggled:

1. Ensure you're extending ThemeAwareBase
2. Ensure you're passing ThemeService to super() in your constructor
3. Check that you're using the isDarkMode property in your template

##### Theme Icon Not Showing

If the theme icon is not showing or updating:

1. Ensure you've overridden usesThemeIcon() to return true
2. Ensure you're using the themeIcon property in your template

##### Memory Leaks

The ThemeAwareBase class automatically handles subscription cleanup in ngOnDestroy. If you override ngOnDestroy in your component, make sure to call super.ngOnDestroy().

### Conclusion

The theme system provides a clean, reusable way to implement theme support in your components. By extending ThemeAwareBase, components automatically get theme state tracking, theme toggling, and proper cleanup of resources.
